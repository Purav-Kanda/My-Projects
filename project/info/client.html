            <h2>3. Team Website Review</h2>
            <p> "I've had the chance to check out the website that ByteMe is developing, and it’s shaping up nicely! The design is clean and sleek, with a simple white and gray color scheme that gives it a modern, professional vibe. The navigation bar at the top is intuitive and easy to use, which makes moving around the site a breeze. I’m also impressed with how well it scales for mobile users – everything remains functional and easy to navigate on smaller screens. The consistent styling across all pages is a big plus, making for a smooth, cohesive experience. Even though it's still in development, I didn’t notice any bugs, and the user interface feels polished."</p>
